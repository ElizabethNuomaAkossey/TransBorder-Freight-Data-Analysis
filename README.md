# 1. Problem Statement
Transborder freight systems are essential to the global economy, but they face significant challenges that hinder their efficiency and growth. These challenges are but not limited to safety, congestion, infrastructure stress, environmental impact, and economic disruptions.
The increasing volume of goods exchanged between nations, fueled by trade agreements like the United-States-Mexico-Canada-Agreement (USMCA), has led to rising congestion at border crossings, putting pressure on existing infrastructure. 

By analyzing transborder freight data, including traffic volumes, delays, environmental impact metrics, and infrastructure usage patterns, we can identify bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and high-risk areas. This analysis can inform strategic investments in infrastructure improvements, the optimization of customs processing, and the implementation of policies aimed at reducing congestion and environmental impact.

# 2. Objectives
The main objective of this project is to analyze the transportation data provided by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) to uncover insights related to the efficiency, safety, and environmental impacts of freight transportation across various modes (road, rail, air, and water). Other key objectives are to;

- analyze the movement of freight across different transportation modes, and identify trends in volume, routing, and modes of transportation used across regions and time periods.
-  investigate areas where transportation systems may experience inefficiencies, such as congestion points, delays, or underutilized infrastructure, and propose methods to optimize resource use and improve throughput.
-  assess the environmental impact of freight transportation by studying data on emissions, fuel usage, and sustainability metrics across different modes of transportation, and recommend strategies for reducing the carbon footprint of the sector.
-  identify transportation safety incidents related to freight, evaluate their causes and consequences, and suggest recommendations for improving safety protocols.
-  analyze how economic disruptions (e.g., trade patterns, policy changes, or global events) impact freight movements and overall transportation efficiency.
