# Problem Statement
Transborder freight systems are essential to the global economy, but they face significant challenges that hinder their efficiency and growth. These challenges are but not limited to safety, congestion, infrastructure stress, environmental impact, and economic disruptions.
The increasing volume of goods exchanged between nations, fueled by trade agreements like the United-States-Mexico-Canada-Agreement (USMCA), has led to rising congestion at border crossings, putting pressure on existing infrastructure. This strain on logistics networks not only increases delivery times and costs but also heightens safety risks and contributes to higher carbon emissions from transportation. These challenges hinder the efficient movement of goods, disrupt supply chains, and create barriers to the growth of cross-border trade, posing significant economic and environmental consequences.
By analyzing transborder freight data, including traffic volumes, delays, environmental impact metrics, and infrastructure usage patterns, we can identify bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and high-risk areas. This analysis can inform strategic investments in infrastructure improvements, the optimization of customs processing, and the implementation of policies aimed at reducing congestion and environmental impact.
